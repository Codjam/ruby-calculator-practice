Hi,

In order to use this calculator it has to be done in the terminal. Use the command "ruby calculator.rb," and then start multiplying, dividing, subtracting, adding, and checking the modulus until your ears fall off. The directions will tell you what to do once "ruby calculator.rb" is typed in to the terminal.

Thank You,

Jamal
